            <h2 class="fact">It happens everywhere</h2>
            <p>A common misconception is human trafficking affects only those of a low socioeconomic status.</p>
            <p>While some factors like poverty, race, and country of origin puts some people at a higher risk; being trafficked can happen to anyone
                in any country of any race, gender, and of any economic standing. Very often it even happens at the hands of someone the victim personally knows.</p>
            <p>This also happens in any type of location from public places in large cities to rural towns where not much seems to happen.</p>

            <h2 class="fact">How we help</h2>
            <p>We begin every operation by establishing a working relationship with law enforcement agencies where we share intel that
                our operators have gathered from talking to local communities and by going undercover as clients.
            </p>
            <p>Our organization is formed of volunteers who risk their lives every day by diving deep into these human-trafficking supply chains.</p>
            <p>Once enough information and evidence is gathered, a strategy is developed, and action is quickly taken.</p>

            <h2 class="fact">Aftercare</h2>
            <p>The suffering for many people does not end upon being rescued from these situations.</p>
            <p>There is much physical and mental healing that is needed after being rescued, and with more and more people being rescued,
                the need for resources is increasing drastically.</p>
            <p>These resources go into medical attention, therapy to overcome trauma, groceries, and education or skill training to help victims
                not only get back on their feet, but to thrive and be able to live normal lives again.
